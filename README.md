Misc. Perl Scripts

These are some Perl scripts that don't justify their own repository.  See
the POD in each script for more details on it.

poolheal - heal characters in C64 Pool of Radiance
poolview - view character stats in C64 Pool of Radiance

These two scripts work with the C64 emulator Vice, by tweaking bytes in the
snapshot file.  Viewing stats is slow, because you have to view each
character individually.  Healing up characters takes forever as characters
reach higher levels, as you repeatedly cast
healing spells and then memorize them.  These scripts speed up both tasks.
